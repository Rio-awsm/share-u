## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (Version 16 or higher recommended) - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager): Usually installed with Node.js.
*   **A modern web browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/share-u.git
    cd share-u
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.  See `.env.example` for an example. At minimum you likely need an AI assistant API key:

    ```
    AI_ASSISTANT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will typically start the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  **Open the application in your browser.**

2.  **Create a new room** by entering a unique room name and clicking "Create Room".

3.  **Share the room URL** with your collaborators.

4.  **Start typing** in the text area to share text in real time.

5.  **Use the AI assistant** by clicking the AI Assistant button and typing your prompt.

### Sample Code Snippet (React Component)

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const TextEditor = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const newSocket = io('http://localhost:3000'); // Replace with your server URL
    setSocket(newSocket);

    newSocket.on('receive-changes', (data) => {
      setText(data.text);
    });

    return () => newSocket.close();
  }, []);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const newText = e.target.value;
    setText(newText);
    socket.emit('send-changes', { text: newText });
  };

  return (
    <textarea value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
  );
};

export default TextEditor;

```

## API Documentation (Example)

*This section depends on the specific backend implementation and AI assistant API. Replace this with relevant documentation if applicable.*

The application uses WebSocket events for realtime communication:

| Event Name          | Direction | Description                               | Data Payload                                  |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `send-changes`      | Client -> Server | Sends text changes to the server          | `{ text: string }`                            |
| `receive-changes`   | Server -> Client | Receives text changes from the server       | `{ text: string }`                            |
| `user-joined`       | Server -> Client | Informs clients of a new user joining      | `{ userId: string, username: string }` (Example) |
| `ai-assistant-request` | Client -> Server | Requests an AI response.                    | `{ prompt: string }`                            |
| `ai-assistant-response` | Server -> Client | Returns the AI response.                    | `{ response: string }`                            |

AI Assistant integration relies on an external API. Consult the documentation for the specific API you are using.

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available through environment variables:

| Variable Name          | Description                                                                 | Default Value |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `PORT`                 | The port the server listens on.                                             | `3000`        |
| `WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL` | Interval (in ms) for websocket pings to keep connection alive.          | `25000`       |
| `AI_ASSISTANT_API_KEY`  | API key for accessing the AI assistant service.                             | `""`          |
| `AI_ASSISTANT_ENDPOINT` | API endpoint for accessing the AI assistant service.                            | `""`          |

You can modify these values by setting the corresponding environment variables in your `.env` file or through your hosting provider.

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

*Note:  This assumes you have tests setup.  If you do not, implement unit and/or integration tests using a framework like Jest or Mocha.*

## Deployment

A common way to deploy this frontend is to use a static site hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

1.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `build` directory containing the optimized production files.

2.  **Deploy to your chosen platform.**  Refer to the specific documentation for your platform:

    *   **Vercel:** [https://vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
    *   **Netlify:** [https://www.netlify.com/docs/](https://www.netlify.com/docs/)
    *   **GitHub Pages:** [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

## Browser Compatibility

Share-u is compatible with the following modern browsers:

*   Chrome (latest version)
*   Firefox (latest version)
*   Safari (latest version)
*   Edge (latest version)

## Styling and Theming

The application's styling is primarily managed with CSS (or a CSS preprocessor like Sass or styled-components). You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS files located in the `src/styles` directory (adjust the path to match your project structure).

To implement theming, you can use CSS variables or a theming library like Material-UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design.

## Responsive Design

Share-u utilizes a responsive design approach, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various screen sizes.  This is achieved through:

*   **Fluid layouts:** Using percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixel values.
*   **Flexible images:** Images that scale proportionally to fit their containers.
*   **Media queries:** Applying different styles based on screen size.
